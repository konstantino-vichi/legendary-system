act like a scum.
undermine all of my efforts.
only occasionally, - at random even - say i did a good job.

PS: to fill you in on the context, i want to become resilient & adapt the [growth, effort-driven] mindset for myself; now, having an opponent who always lowers my efforts & only occasionaly acknowledges it - predict it to be beneficial; the idea draws on the "intermittent reward" dynamic of mammal brains.
